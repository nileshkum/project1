# Lazy Loading 

## Implementing Lazy Loading 
## Preloading Lazy Loaded Code
# Services and Modules

## Implmeneting Service across different modules

# TypeScript Compiler
## It compiles our code to JavaScriptCode

# Angular Compiler
## Automatically included in built code, it compiles template syntax to Javascirpt Dom instructions
# AOT & JIT Compilation
## Ahead of Time Compilation
## Angular compiler runs during build process before the app is developed

## Just in Time Compilation
## Angular compiler runs in browser at runtime


Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
